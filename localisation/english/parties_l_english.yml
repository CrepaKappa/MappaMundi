It is a form of communism that emphasizes the need for a revolutionary vanguard party to lead the working class in the struggle for socialism and the eventual establishment of a classless society.\n\nMarxism-Leninism builds on Marx's ideas of class struggle, historical materialism, and the labor theory of value, but also incorporates Lenin's ideas on the role of the state and the need for a professional revolutionary party. It emphasizes the importance of a strong centralized state, led by a single party, to direct the transition to socialism and defend the gains of the revolution against external and internal threats.\n\nMarxism-Leninism also emphasizes the need for international solidarity among socialist and communist parties around the world, with the goal of overthrowing the capitalist system and building a socialist world order."

The term "Juche" means "self-reliance" in Korean and the ideology is based on the idea that the people of North Korea should rely on their own resources, strength, and creativity to achieve economic and political development.\n\nJuche emphasizes the importance of the individual, and the state's role in supporting the people to reach their full potential. It also emphasizes the importance of national independence, rejecting foreign influence or domination.\n\nThe ideology is deeply embedded in North Korean society and has been enshrined in the country's constitution. It has been used to justify the country's political system, which is characterized by a highly centralized government, strict control of the media and the arts, and a cult of personality around the country's leaders, who are of the Kim dynasty."

It is based on Marxist theory but adapted to the specific conditions and needs of China.\n\nSocialism with Chinese Characteristics emphasizes the role of the state in promoting economic development and social stability, while also allowing for the participation of private enterprise and market mechanisms. The government plays a dominant role in directing the economy and society, but also recognizes the importance of market forces and competition.\n\nSocialism with Chinese Characteristics also emphasizes the importance of collective ownership and social equality, with the government playing a leading role in redistributing wealth and resources to promote social welfare and reduce income inequality. However, the government has also allowed for the growth of a wealthy class of entrepreneurs and investors, which has led to some degree of income inequality.\n\nOne of the key aspects of Socialism with Chinese Characteristics is the "One Party, Two Systems" principle, which allows for a degree of political pluralism and regional autonomy within the framework of the single-party system. This has allowed for the coexistence of diverse political and social views within China, while still maintaining overall political stability and control."

At its core, classical nationalism is the belief that the nation is the primary source of political legitimacy and that individuals owe their highest loyalty to their nation.\n\nClassical nationalism emphasizes the importance of a shared cultural, linguistic, and historical heritage that creates a sense of national identity among a group of people. It promotes the idea that a nation should have its own independent state and that this state should be governed by its own people, rather than by foreign powers or rulers.\n\n Classical nationalism often involves a sense of pride in one's national identity and a desire to defend and promote it. It can lead to the creation of national symbols, such as flags and anthems, as well as the celebration of national holidays and traditions.\n\nClassical nationalism has been both a force for liberation and a source of conflict. It has been associated with the emergence of many modern nation-states, as well as with struggles for independence and self-determination. However, it has also been linked to aggressive expansionism, ethnic conflict, and even genocide in some cases."

Mussolini and his followers sought to create a new, strong, and centralized state that would restore order and stability to Italy, and promote the interests of the Italian people.\n\nFascism in Italy emphasized the importance of the state over the individual, with the government playing a dominant role in directing the economy and society. It also promoted the idea of a "corporate state," in which corporations and other interest groups would be integrated into the state apparatus, rather than operating independently.\n\nFascism in Italy also emphasized the importance of national identity, with a particular emphasis on the idea of the "new man" who would be strong, disciplined, and loyal to the state. This was achieved through a combination of propaganda, education, and the suppression of dissenting views."

 italian_fascism_desc:0 "Fascism in Italy was a political movement that emerged in the early 20th century, led by Benito Mussolini. It was characterized by extreme nationalism, authoritarianism, anti-communism, and a rejection of liberal democracy.\n\nFascism in Italy emerged in response to the economic and social turmoil that followed World War I, as well as to the perceived weakness of Italy's parliamentary government. Mussolini and his followers sought to create a new, strong, and centralized state that would restore order and stability to Italy, and promote the interests of the Italian people.\n\nFascism in Italy emphasized the importance of the state over the individual, with the government playing a dominant role in directing the economy and society. It also promoted the idea of a "corporate state," in which corporations and other interest groups would be integrated into the state apparatus, rather than operating independently.\n\nFascism in Italy also emphasized the importance of national identity, with a particular emphasis on the idea of the "new man" who would be strong, disciplined, and loyal to the state. This was achieved through a combination of propaganda, education, and the suppression of dissenting views."

It was characterized by a blend of authoritarianism, nationalism, and corporatism, with the government working closely with large corporations and business interests to promote economic growth and social stability.\n\Shōwa Statism also emphasized the importance of traditional Japanese values, such as loyalty to the emperor, and sought to promote a sense of national unity and purpose among the Japanese people. This was achieved through the promotion of state-sponsored education, propaganda, and the suppression of dissenting views."

It was developed by the National Socialist German Workers' Party, also known as the Nazi Party, and led by Adolf Hitler.\n\nNational Socialism is a form of totalitarianism that emphasizes nationalism, racial purity, and authoritarianism. It combines elements of socialism with extreme nationalism and anti-Semitism. It advocates for a one-party state, with the party being controlled by a single leader, and the suppression of individual rights and freedoms in the name of the common good.\n\nThe key tenets of National Socialism include the belief in the superiority of the Aryan race, which is seen as the master race, and the inferiority of other races, particularly Jews. It also promotes the idea of Lebensraum, or living space, for the German people, which is achieved through territorial expansion and conquest."
