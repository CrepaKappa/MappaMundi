POLITICS_COLLECTIVE_LEADERSHIP_DESC:0 "The centralized state that once controlled this area has collapsed.

POLITICS_UNC_PENGUIN_DESC:0 "The emperor penguin is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and is endemic to Antarctica.\n\nLike all penguins it is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. Its diet consists primarily of fish, but also includes crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid.\n\nThe emperor penguin has a circumpolar distribution in the Antarctic almost exclusively between the 66° and 77° south latitudes. It almost always breeds on stable pack ice near the coast and up to 18km offshore."
POLITICS_UNC_NULLIUS_DESC:0 "Terra nullius, or No man's land, consists of territory not officially claimed by any sovereign nation.\n\nMost examples of terra nullius are either completely uninhabited or lack any semblance of a state structure, and as such there very few genuine cases in the modern world."
POLITICS_ATC_AUTHREP_DESC:0 "The Antarctic Treaty System regulates international relations with respect to Antarctica, establishing a scientific preserve over the continent.\n\nSince the Treaty entered into force in 1961, the legal status of previous Antarctic claims established by its signatories has become dubious, an issue not helped by contested claims between some nations."

POLITICS_THOREZ_DESC:0 "Maurice Thorez (1900-1964) was a prominent French communist and was a leader of the French Communist Party. Born in 1900 in Noyelles-Godault, he joined the French Section of the Worker's Internationale (SFIO), but joined the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1920 when it split off. He quickly rose through the ranks of the PCF, becoming leader of the party in 1930, which he would be until his death.\n\nIn 1934, Thorez helped establish the Popular Front in France, a coalition that won the 1936 Election, putting the PCF in government until 1938, when the Front collapsed over conflicted opinions with the Munich agreement. During WWII, he would be in Moscow. In France, Jacques Duclos, Thorez's right-hand man, encouraged members to fight the German occupation, a move that would popularize the party after the war.\n\nIn November 1944, Thorez would return after his 4-year exile in Moscow. In the years between WWII and the Cold War, the PCF would be a popular party in France, mainly due to its role in the French Resistance. In the 1945 Election, a reformed Popular Front won, making Thorez Vice Premier. However, this government would again collapse in 1947 due to rising pressure from the Americans to kick out the communists from government, which happened, causing the May Crisis. He retained his leadership until he died in 1964 at the age of 64, on a cruise in the Black Sea.\n\nBut what if this happened differently? If the communists managed to seize power after WWII, and the May Crises of '47 never affected France? Or things could've proceeded differently in the '30s, and Thorez could have absolute control of France. The choice is yours."
POLITICS_PIVERT_DESC:0 "Marceau Pivert (1895-1958) was a French communist during the Interwar Period and into the Cold War. Born 1895 in Montmachoux, Paris, he was a soldier during WWI, which made him a staunch pacifist. After WWI, he became a teacher until 1939.\n\nHe joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in 1924 and was very radical compared to other members. In the 1930s, he began organizing the most radical members of the party into the 'Revolutionary Left' faction. The faction would soon come to be at odds with the SFIO, especially after the SFIO became part of the French Government in 1936 and Léon Blum became Prime Minister. The divides became so deep that Pivert and his faction left the SFIO and established their party, the Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party (PSOP).\n\nIn 1940, after the Fall of France, Phillipe Pétain banned and dissolved the PSOP, causing Pivert to flee to Mexico. After the war, most of the party, including himself, rejoined the SFIO, while some joined the French Communist Party (PCF), which had grown significantly from the war. Despite making amends with the SFIO, he disagreed with them frequently, most notably his stance on the Algerian War, where he supported Algerian independence, going against the vast majority of the party. He died in 1958 at the age of 62.\n\nUltimately, Marceau Pivert never had much of an impact on French politics. What if that was different? What if Marceau Pivert and the PSOP became popular? Maybe worked with the PCF, or maybe even merged with it, seizing power in France? The choice is yours."
POLITICS_BLUM_DESC:0 "Léon Blum (1872-1950) was a prominent French Socialist during the Interwar Period and the beginning of the Cold War. Born in 1872 in Paris to a middle-class Jewish family, Blum was uninterested in politics as a child. However, the Dreyfus Affair in 1894 exposed systemic racism against Jews in French society, sparking a nationwide controversy.\n\nIn 1914, Jean Jaurès, a mentor and idol for Blum, was assassinated. Blum became involved in the French Section of the Worker's Internationale (SFIO) SFIO and became chair of the party's executive committee in 1919. In 1920, the French Communist Party (PCF) split from the SFIO due to disagreements on the Russian Revolution. In 1935, the SFIO, PCF, and other parties formed the Popular Front Coalition, and in 1936, they managed to form a government, making Blum Prime Minister. Despite the early success of the government, issues soon arose, and the coalition was volatile, leading Blum to resign in 1937. He returned to the position briefly in 1938, but the Popular Front quickly collapsed due to the Munich Agreement.\n\nAfter the German invasion of France, Blum did not attempt to free, despite severe risks, with him being both a socialist and Jew. The fear was confirmed, as he was arrested and sent to a concentration camp, but he survived. After the war, Blum returned to politics and was Prime Minister again during a brief interim government. He died in 1950 at the age of 77.\n\nBlum played a role in French politics during the 1930s but fell short due to instability in his government. What if he steered his party through those times? What if the Popular Front ruled France for most of the Interwar period? The choice is yours."
POLITICS_JEANIII_DESC:0 "Jean d'Orléans, the Duke of Guise (1874-1940), known to Orleanists as Jean III, born in 1874, was the Orleanist claimant to the French throne. As a young adult, Jean settled in his estate, Nouvion-en-Thiérache. However, in 1909, wanting to help France expand overseas, the family moved to Larache, Morocco. However, in 1912, when France and Spain partitioned Morocco, Larache went to the Spanish, displeasing Jean greatly.\n\nWhen WWI broke out, Jean offered to serve. The French declined, not wanting nobles to partake in military service. However, the French allowed him to participate in a mission to Bulgaria in 1915, attempting to convince King Ferdinand I, his uncle, to join the Entente. The mission failed, as Bulgaria would join the Triple Alliance.\n\nAfter the war, Jean would return to Larache. In 1900, he was only a cadet in the family, very far from inheriting the throne.  However, he would become the Orleanist claimant in 1926. Due to the Exile Law of 1886, heads of the Orléans, Bonaparte, and Bourbon families weren't allowed to live in French territory. Therefore, he had to move to Belgium. After Germany invaded Belgium, he fled back to Larache, where he died a few months later at the age of 65.\n\nWhile Jean never managed to seize the French throne, what if he did? The French Action Party (AF), a reactionary Orleanist party, planned a coup d'etat to restore the monarchy, although the plan never came to fruition. However, if it did, the Orleanists would secure the French throne, and millions of things would become possible. The choice is yours."
POLITICS_DALADIER_DESC:0 "Édouard Daladier (1884-1970) was a French politician during the interwar period and was Prime Minister of France. He was born in 1884 in Carpentras, a small town in Provence.\n\nHe became Mayor of Carpentras in 1912. He ran to join the Chamber of Deputies but lost to the Radical-Socialist Party (PRRS). In WWI, he was a soldier. After the war, he returned to politics, entered the Chamber of Deputies, and joined the PRRS. Daladier served in several governmental positions during the Interwar period. In 1933, he became Prime Minister, but his government collapsed nine months later. However, in the wake of a major corruption scandal in the French government, Daladier was able to take power, although the government fell in a week because of riots that brought down his government. In 1935, he formed a coalition with the French Communist Party (PCF) and the French Section of the Worker's Internationale (SFIO), which would win the 1936 Election.\n\nHowever, the government would collapse due to disagreements on the Munich Agreement. Contradicting the SFIO and PCF, the PRRS went through with the agreement and took absolute control of the government, which made Daladier Prime Minister. Daladier resigned in March of 1940. The Nazis imprisoned him until 1945. He returned to politics briefly in the Chamber of Deputies and became Mayor of Avignon in 1953. After that, he retired from politics and died in 1970 at 86.\n\nWhile Daladier ultimately went through with the Munich Agreement, that doesn't mean he liked it; he only went through with it because Chamberlain did. What if someone else was in power instead of Chamberlain? Could an early WWII happen? The choice is yours." 
POLITICS_LEBRUN_DESC:0 "Albert Lebrun (1871-1950) was a French politician and President during the early 1900s and the Interwar Period. He was born in 1871 in Mercy-le-Haut, a small village in the Meurthe-et-Moselle area. He'd become a mining engineer, though he would enter politics in 1900, joining the Chamber of Deputies. In the 1910s, he'd have many roles in the French government.\n\nAfter the war, he joined the Democratic Republican Alliance (ARD) and was elected to the French Senate, being its Vice President from 1925-1929 and President of the Senate from 1931-1932. In the aftermath of the assassination of President Paul Doumer in 1932, Lebrun would be elected President of France. He was re-elected in 1939, although it would not last long; as France collapsed in 1940, Prime Minister Paul Reynaud resigned, recommending Philippe Pétain as his replacement, which Lebrun would do. After the Chamber of Deputies allowed Pétain to rewrite the Constitution and sign an armistice with Germany, Pétain ousted Lebrun after a brief power struggle.\n\nHe fled to Vizille, a small town in southeastern France, where he remained under the radar until he was captured by the Wehrmacht in 1943. He'd be held in Castle Itter until he was allowed to leave due to sickness, but he'd remain under heavy surveillance. Lebrun retired from politics after the war and died of pneumonia in 1950 at the age of 78.\n\nLebrun played his role in France. He was a popular President, working across the aisle, which could've made him a longtime President if Germany didn't invade them. What if this happened? What if, for whatever reason, Germany didn't invade France? Lebrun could've peacefully ruled France as a popular President for many years. The choice is yours."
POLITICS_NAPOLEONVI_DESC:0 "Louis, Prince Napoléon (1914-1997), also known as Napoléon VI, was the Bonapartist claimant to the French throne from 1926 to 1997. Due to the Law of Exile, a French 1886 law that prevented French claimants and their heirs from living in France, Louis was born in 1914 in Brussels. As a child, Louis drifted between England, Belgium, and Switzerland. When his father Victor died in 1926, he became the Bonapartist claimant to the French throne. However, he wasn't of age, so his mother, Princess Clémentine of Belgium, acted as 'regent' until he came of age.\n\nIn 1939, when World War II broke out, Louis wrote a letter to Prime Minister Édouard Daladier, requesting to join the army. When his request was declined, Louis joined the French Foreign Legion under the alias Louis Blanchard. However, the Legion was disbanded in 1941, following the Second Compiègne Armistice. After his demobilization, he joined the French Resistance but was later arrested by German authorities. After his release, he rejoined the Resistance, under a new alias, Louis Monnier.\n\nAfter the war, he would be decorated for his service, and the Law of Exile was repealed, meaning he could live in France again, but Louis chose to remain in Switzerland. Later in his life, he became a successful businessman. He lived a quiet life after the war and died in 1997 at the age of 83.\n\nLouis could've become the Emperor of France, but that didn't happen; the Bonapartist monarchy was abolished after the Franco-Prussian War. However, what if the Franco-Prussian War didn't happen, or France won? Not only would the world be very different, but France would have been a monarchy for much longer. The choice is yours."
POLITICS_ROCQUE_DESC:0 "François de la Rocque (1885-1946) was a French reactionary during the Interwar Period, and he lead the famous right-wing Croix-de-Feu (CdF) from 1930 to 1936. Born in 1885 in Lorient, Brittany, he joined the military in 1907 and climb up the ranks for two decades, before resigning as Lieutenant Colonel in 1927. He joined the CdF in 1929, and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming the leader of the CdF the next year. The Great Depression would drive many to extremes, making the CdF mainstream.\n\nIn 1934, a wave of far-right riots passed over France, mainly organized by the CdF and the French Action Party (AF). In the evening, La Rocque ordered the CdF rioters to disband, while other far-right rioters, with greatly reduced strength, were put down by police. La Rocque received criticism from all over the right wing, blaming him for not causing the overthrow of the Third Republic.\n\nIn 1936, the Popular Front dissolved the CdF, and in response, La Rocque founded the French Social Party (PSF), a significantly more moderate party. After the Fall of France in 1940, La Rocque initially collaborated with the Nazis but would begin working against them in 1942, leaking intelligence to the British. However, he would be arrested by the Germans in 1943, and wouldn't be freed until the end of the war. He died in 1946 at the age of 60.\n\nFrançois de la Rocque was very popular amongst French reactionaries during the Interwar, only second to Charles Maurras and the AF. However, the riots of 1934 nearly swept reactionaries into power; if La Rocque's rioters joined the AF, they may have toppled the Third Republic. The choice is yours."

POLITICS_ALFONSO_XIII_DESC:0 "Alfonso XIII (1886-1941) was the last King of Spain from 1886 to the abolition of the monarchy in 1931. Alfonso XIII was born in 1886 in Madrid. His father, Alfonso XII, died six months before his birth, making him the King of Spain upon his birth. His mother, Maria Christina of Austria, served as regent until he came of age.\n\nDespite being a constitutional monarch, Alfonso heavily interfered in politics, which drew criticism from many politicians, leading to growing Republican sentiment in the country. This came to head in 1931 when many in the Spanish Cortes held a debate about grievances against Alfonso. To avoid the extensive scrutiny of the legislature, Alfonso launched a coup with a few military generals. This coup failed, the monarchy was abolished, and Alfonso was forced into exile.\n\nAfter the abolition of the monarchy, many of Alfonso's sons renounced their claims to the throne, leaving his third son, Juan, heir to the defunct throne. When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, no sides supported restoring the monarchy, so Alfonso had little involvement in the war. He died in 1941 at the age of 54.\n\nAlfonso XIII was the last King of Spain, but many things could have gone differently. In 1906, Alfonso XIII and his wife were nearly killed by a Catalonian anarchist. At that time, Alfonso had no son, so what if the assassination attempt succeeded? Spain would've been plunged into chaos. Or what if Alfonso navigated through the crisis in 1931, maintaining the monarchy? The choice is yours."

### RUSSIA ###
POLITICS_PUTIN_DESC:0 "Vladimir Putin (1952-) is a divisive and controversial figure on the global stage, ruling as President of the Russian Federation. Born in 1952 in Leningrad, he is currently 70.\n\nIn 1975, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and the KGB. He would resign in 1991 during the August Coup. In 1990, his political career would begin as an aide to Mayor Anatoly Sobchack of Leningrad. In 1995, he joined the Our Home - Russia (NDR). In 1996, he moved to Moscow, and in 1997 would be in Boris Yeltsin's cabinet. In 1999, he would be Prime Minister. Despite being recently unknown to most Russians, he would later become popular due to his policy on law and order and the Second Chechen War. In 1999, Putin joined the Unity Party, ran for President, and was runner-up to Yeltsin. However, Yeltsin resigned on New Year's Eve 1999, which made Putin President.\n\nSince Putin took power in 1999, Russia has become more corrupt and authoritarian, as freedoms are further restricted, while Putin moves around the Constitution to keep himself in power. In 2014, President Viktor Yanukovych of Ukraine was ousted in what is known as the Revolution of Dignity. In response, Russia annexed Crimea and began to aid pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas, starting the Donbas War. However, in February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\nToday, the war is in a stalemate after a failed offensive to take Kyiv was pushed back. What will the future of Russia be? Will Putin continue to stay in power, as he already has done for 20 years? Or was Ukraine the last straw? Will WW3 start? Will Putin's regime fall? The choice is yours." #Needs Test
