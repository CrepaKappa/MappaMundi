 ICE_MM_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "When using Mappa Mundi, we recommend that you play as Iceland. Iceland's lack of foreign cores, decent size, and isolated position make it ideal for transfering states to in order to release new nations.\n\nReleasing nations directly as the occupier or through the console may release the nation far larger than you'd like, and can create issues due to removing cores of occupiers. In addition, some countries are unable to release other nations due to game mechanics not used in Mappa Mundi."
 OTHER_MM_BOOKMARK_DESC:0 "If you'd like to tag switch between occupiers and release nations that way, feel free to select this option to view the map and pick any country to start as."
 MM_1939_DESC:0 "It's been 20 years since the signing of the treaty of Versailles and Germany is once again on the verge of war, Hitler's Germany has already peacefully annexed Austria and Czechoslovakia, and now the Reich is looking towards Poland, specifically, to reconquer it's old imperial lands, and expand the German Lebensraum, but Poland is stubborn and is refusing to ceede any land, with both armies rapidly mobilizing, everyone knows, that a new great war is about to begin, meanwhile in Asia, Japan got bogged down in China, but is still looking very ambitiously towards the South."
 MM_MODERN_DAY_DESC:0 "The collapse of the Soviet Union brought massive changes to the world, on the corpse of the old union, a new Russia was created, it's not nearly as strong as it used to be, but it still remains a threat to be reckoned with, America now stands victorious over communism as the greatest global power, but for how long? After the USSR crumbled, a new contender against America rose up, China, that gets stronger and more ambitious every day. Will America manage to outlive a communist power once again, or will this time be different?"
 MM_1936_DESC:0 "Dark times are coming. In Europe, 2 years ago, Hitler has consolidated his power and his attention is now increasingly drawn beyond Germany's borders, as he wishes to create a great German state and stomp communism to the ground. Mussolini's Italy continues to embark on daring military adventures in the hopes of rebuilding the Roman Empire, while the Empire of Japan stands poised to attack China and possibly the great european powers in Asia or even turn north and destroy the Soviet Union. The world has yet again been doused in gasoline. A single spark may be all it takes."
 MM_1914_DESC:0 "Years ago, Europe divided itself into 2 great factions, The Central Powers and the Entente, with France wanting to avenge it's defeat in the Franco-Prussian war, and Germany wanting to spread it's influence and power all over the globe, a new war was inevitable, the only question that remained was when will it happen?, but now, we know the answer, as it's been exactly one month since the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, by Serbian nationalists. With Austria-Hungary furious, and the Entente backing Serbia, the Great War is about to begin. A Great War that will eclipse every other war in Europe for its brutality."
 MM_1836_DESC:0 "§R(WORK IN PROGRESS)§! It's been 21 years since the Congress of Vienna and the ultimate defeat of Napoleon, Europe has been greatly changed in hope of creating a balance of power. Great Britain, after winning the 7 years' war solidified it's position as the leading colonial empire of the world, and is looking towards spreading itself even further on every continent. In Europe the ideals of the French Revolution haven't died, and revolutionary ideas such as liberalism and nationalism are spreading across Europe like a wildfire, with Italian and German people wanting to create unified states, and many countries wanting independence, it's obvious that Europe is about to change forever, perhaps in ways the Monarchic powers do not want."
 MM_DEATH_DESC:0 "§RWARNING:TAKES LONG TO LOAD, OR WON'T EVEN LOAD AT ALL. DON'T SAY WE DIDN'T WARN YOU§! \n\nIn the Grim Darkness of the Near...ish Future, all nations ruined, except for the poor lonely island of Iceland.

 MM_1950_DESC:0 "The Second World War was Over. The Axis Powers lay defeated. Japan Occupied. Germany Partitioned. And yet, the elusive concept of world peace could not be realised as a new order rose from the ashes of the war. The order of new superpowers, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. As Europe destroyed itself in the course of the war, it laid helpless as their colonies began to break away and themselves fell to the sway of the either of the two superpowers. They now seek to one up each other, though not direcly for the fear of burning the world with the newly created and deployed Atom Bombs which decisively ended the war in the Pacific a mere 5 years ago. Now is the type of a new sort of war, the proxy wars. Now begins, the Cold War."
