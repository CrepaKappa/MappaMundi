## Subideology Icons ##

Subideology icons should be 66x68

No more than 3 objects should be used in a subideology icon unless there is a reason why

To make an item seem to have depth, copy the object, emboss it, and set it as an overlay to the orignal object. (there are better ways to do this, but if you want to do it a faster way then do this)

Always have at least one part of the icon pop out of the frame.
